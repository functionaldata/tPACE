Description: Provides implementation of various methods of Functional Data
    Analysis (FDA) and Empirical Dynamics. The core of this package is Functional
    Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), a key technique for functional data
    analysis, for sparsely or densely sampled random trajectories and time courses,
    via the Principal Analysis by Conditional Estimation (PACE) algorithm or
    numerical integration. PACE is useful for the analysis of data that have been
    generated by a sample of underlying (but usually not fully observed) random
    trajectories. It does not rely on pre-smoothing of trajectories, which is
    problematic if functional data are sparsely sampled. PACE provides options
    for functional regression and correlation, for Longitudinal Data Analysis,
    the analysis of stochastic processes from samples of realized trajectories,
    and for the analysis of underlying dynamics. The core computational algorithms
    are implemented using the 'Eigen' C++ library for numerical linear algebra and
    'RcppEigen' "glue".
