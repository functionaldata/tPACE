\title{Convert support of a mu/phi/cov etc. to and from obsGrid and workGrid}
\usage{
ConvertSupport(
  fromGrid,
  toGrid,
  mu = NULL,
  Cov = NULL,
  phi = NULL,
  isCrossCov = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fromGrid}{vector of points with input grid to interpolate from}

\item{toGrid}{vector of points with the target grid to interpolate on}

\item{mu}{any vector of function to be interpolated}

\item{Cov}{a square matrix supported on fromGrid * fromGrid, to be interpolated to toGrid * toGrid.}

\item{phi}{any matrix, each column containing a function to be interpolated}

\item{isCrossCov}{logical, indicating whether the input covariance is a cross-covariance. If so then the output is not made symmetric.}
}
\description{
Convert the support of a given function 1-D or 2-D function from \code{fromGrid} to \code{toGrid}.
Both grids need to be sorted. This is an interpolation/convenience function.
}
