\description{
A dataset containing the eggs laid from 789 medflies (Mediterranean fruit flies,
 Ceratitis capitata) during the first 25 days of their lives. This is a subset of 
the dataset used by Carey at al. (1998); only flies that lived at least 25 days 
are included, i.e, at the end of the recording period [0,25] all flies are still alive.
