\description{
A dataset containing the eggs laid from 789 medflies (Mediterranean fruit flies,
 Ceratitis capitata) during the first 25 days of their lives. This is a subset of 
the dataset used by Carey at al. (1998); only flies having lived at least 25 days 
are shown. At the end of the recording period all flies were still alive.
