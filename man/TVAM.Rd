\description{
Smooth backfitting procedure for time-varying additive models
}
\details{
\code{TVAM} estimates component surfaces of time-varying additive models for longitudinal observations based on the smooth backfitting algorithm proposed by Zhang et al. (2013). \code{TVAM} only focuses on the local constant smooth backfitting in contrast to the original development as in Zhang et al. (2013). However, the local polynomial version can be extended similarly, so that those are omitted in the development. Especially in this development, one can designate an estimation support of additive surfaces when the additive modeling is only allowed over restricted intervals or one is interested in the modeling over the support (see Han et al., 2016).
